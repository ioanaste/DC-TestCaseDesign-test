# test-case-design-test
A basic level test case design test for applicants for QA positions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXERCISE 1: DECISION TABLE

The behavior of a component can be described by the business logic
- The input consists of a card from a standard deck of playing cards
- The output consists of a numeric value derived from the card
- Red cards have positive (+) output
- Black cards have negative (-) output
- Each number card has a base value of the number on the card
- Each face card has a base value of 20
- If a number card has an even number double the base value
- If a number card has an odd number half the base value

1. Work out the Decision Table (as f.e. described in the ISTQB Foundation curriculum) which represents this behavior and save your results in the 'Decision Table' tab of the 'TestCaseDesignTest.xlsx' spreadsheet contained in the test-case-design-test solution.
2. Work out a set of physical test cases where each test case represents one of the scenarios derived in '1' and save your results in the 'Physical Test Cases' tab of the 'TestCaseDesignTest.xlsx' spreadsheet contained in the test-case-design-test solution.

     1. Install Git to your local system
     2. Go to https://github.com and sign in (create an account if you don't have one)
     3. Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/test-case-design-test
     4. Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
     5. Use the provided .git URL to clone the repository to your local system with the installed Git client (again: do **NOT** fork)
2. Or download
     1. Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/test-case-design-test
     2. Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
     3. Click on the 'Download ZIP' button to download a copy of the solution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:

There are two ways to hand in the exercise:
1. Either commit your solution to a GitHub repository of your own (preferred):
     1. Commit your solution to the test to your local Git repository
     2. Push your commit upstream to your GitHub repository
     3. Send an email with a link to the branch of your GitHub repository containing your 
       work to your contact at the office
2. Or make a .zip or .7z of your solution and email it to your contact at the 
   office
